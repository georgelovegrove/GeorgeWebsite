                <p>For this project an assortment of icons were needed to represent each hobby. To cater 
                for this I created well over 100 icons for use in the application. A small selection is shown below. </p>

                <img className="hobby_icon_selection" src="/projects/iconselection.png" />

                <p>I designed the website and application from wireframe to final designs using Sketch. After the designs were completed
                I developed the website and lead the application design implementation using React Native. 
                An example screen for the website homepage is shown below.</p>
