### Implementation history

Please refer to the DEVHISTORY.md file to see the history of development from start to finish.

### TODOS

- Link up images for projects on homepage correctly
- Add proper validation on the form inputs for both login and add project (should be able to use ReduxForm for the majority)
- Find a way to do correct redirects before a page is loaded, perhaps using React Router onEnter()
- Refactor any necessary components where they should be able to become functions instead of classes
- Do setupwebsite page with documentation on how website was made for the first project

### Eventually TODOS

- Add a date picker to add project form
- Add an image uploader instead of a relative URL that resizes the image and saves it as a base64 string in the projects collection
